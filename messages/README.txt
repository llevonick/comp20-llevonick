All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented. All file names
are correct and Git commit messages were made in the process of putting
together this assignment. Also, my JavaScript code parses the JSON and modifies
the "messages" section of HTML. Then I styled the page by using the blank CSS
file that was given.  The README file addresses the important questions
asked in this lab underneath the dash marks. Finally, I did not modify the
given HTML file and did not use jQuery for this assignment.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

This assignment took me about 2 hours to complete.

Is it possible to request data from a different origin?:
This is not possible as it breaks the same origin policy.  This means that the
data from one origin can't interact with a resource from a seperate origin.

Is it possible to request data from your local machine?:
This depends on the browser that is being used and its security settings.
For instance, when I tried to do this it did not work on Safari or Chrome, but
it did work on Firefox.
