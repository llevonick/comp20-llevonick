All aspects of this lab have been correctly implemented. All files were
correctly named and concise Git commit messages were made.  The JavaScript
function was modified to parse the JSON data and to output the messages in the
"messages" section of the HTML file.  Also, the Javascript console was checked
to make sure there were no errors in the HTML file.  There are no outputs in
the JavaScript console, the HTML was not modified, I didn't use jQuery, and the
README file meets all requirements.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

I spent about 3 hours working on this lab.
