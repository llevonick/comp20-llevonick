The purpose of this Git repository was to record the progress made on the
files of our assignements.  As goals were reached and the code changed more
this repository was updated to hold the updated files.  This way if I
ever wanted to revert back to certain code I had the option to do so and I
could look at the progress I was making with my assignment.

My favorite lab was the MBTA lab because we were able to continue to build on
it based on the new things we were learning throughout the course.

I feel like I have grown alot from day 1 of this course! When I started I
didn't know anything about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Github, Heroku, or Mongodb,
so this class has helped me to become more knowlegable in all of these areas.

I think one of the most important things I've learned in this course is just
the simple knowledge of how to use GitHub as a few times I changed code in my
assignments but realized what I had done previously worked better, so tracking
my progress on that specific project in GitHub allowed me to change it back.
Also, an important thing I learned was how to use javascript.  At first, I
found it a little confusing because of its differences with C++ but after some
time working with it I figured out how to get javascript code to do what I
wanted it to do!

After taking this course I think it would be interesting to continue to learn
more about web security! The week we spent learning about it was engaging and
although I didn't use any of the software you said we could use for Lab 13
like Burp Suite it would be nice to learn how it functions.
