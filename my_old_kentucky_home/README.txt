All aspects of this assignment were correctly implemented. All names of folders
files and the README were correcly executed.  The index.html file made it so
the music video was annotated with the lyrics of the song line by line and two
images were in the annotation, one at the beginning of the song and one at the
end.  The only part of the HTML file that I modified was within the <script>
</script> section. Styling for the page was then created in a style.css
document.  Finally, I did not use jQuery, there were no errors or outputs in
the JavaScript console, and all README file description tasks were met.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

This assignment took me around 2 hours to complete.
