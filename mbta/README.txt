All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented. The project
was placed in the correct repository folder, there is one css file for the
project, and there is a seperate file for the JavaScript code.  Also, the map
takes up the entire page and is centered on South Station.  All of the Red Line
subway stations are marked on the map, as well as the Blue Line, Orange
Line, and Commuter Rail stations. Then the same marker was used for all of
the stations. Finally, a red polyline was rendered connecting the Red Line
stations, an orange polyline was rendered connecting the Orange Line stations,
a purple line was rendered connecting the Commuter Rail stations, and a blue
polyline was rendered connecting the Blue Line stations.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

The required section of this assignment took me about 4 hours to complete.
Adding in the Blue and Orange lines took about an hour total. Finally, adding
in the Commuter Rail took a long time because it contains so many stops, so it
probably took me over 2 hours.
