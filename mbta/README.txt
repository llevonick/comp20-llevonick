All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented. The user's
location is determined and then marked on the map with a different icon than
the icons used for the Red Line stations.  Also, on the map is a mint
colored line connecting this marker to the closest Red Line station.  When the
location marker of the user is clicked the infowindow tells the user which
red line station is the closest to them and how many miles away it is. Also,
when one of the red line station markers is clicked on an infowindow appears 
that displays the upcoming trains for that station.  Finally, as a part of the
"Going Beyond" section of the assignment, there are markers on the map tha look
like mini trains which signify where the Red Line subway trains are on the map
based on the JSON data feed.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

In order to calculate the distace between 2 geopoints with the Haversine
formula for this assignment, the following link was used in order to implement
that formula in JavaScript: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript

It took me over 7 hours to complete this assignment.
