All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented. The project
was placed in the correct repository folder, there is one css file for the
project, and there is a seperate file for the JavaScript code.  Also, the map
takes up the entire page and is centered on South Station.  All of the Red Line
subway stations are marked on the map, as well as the Blue Line and Orange
Line subway stations.  Then the same marker was used for all of the stations.
Finally, a red polyline was rendered connecting the Red Line stations, an
orange polyline was rendered connecting the Orange Line stations, and a blue
polyline was rendered connecting the Blue Line stations.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

The required section of this assignment took me about 4 hours to complete.
Adding in the Blue and Orange lines took about an hour total.
