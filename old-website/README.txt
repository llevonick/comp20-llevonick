All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented.  All files
were successfuly put into my repo llevonick.github.io.  One of these files was
resume.html, which included my name, education, relevant coursework,
professional expereince, skills, and activities.  There was also bio.html which
included a short bio of myself and index.html which included my name, a photo
of me, a link to my resume, and a link to my bio.  The final file was
portfolio.css which was the style sheet for all 3 of these html pages. There
were more than 5 rules within this CSS file.  All of my html files passed the
official HTML5 specifications and my CSS file passed official CSS validation.
Throughout the process of this assignment, I pushed my work to GitHub while
committing meaningful messages.  Finally, I did not use any front-end framework
to make my project.

I did not colloborate with anyone on this project.

I spent probably about 3-4 hours on this project, mainly so I could fool
around with HTML and CSS and see how they work, as I am new to them.
