All aspects of this assignment have been correctly implemented.  In an html
page I wrote for the sections: introduction, methodology, abstract of findings,
issues found, and conclusion.  Along with the issues found section, all
subsections of this topic were covered as well.  I ended up covering 5
vulnerabilities that I found in the web application in the issues section of
the write-up.  Also, some of the issues with this web application were shown
by me taking advantage of them on vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com, as I injected
a gif as one of the login names, then I made the page redirect to 
http://heyyeyaaeyaaaeyaeyaa.com, and finally I made it so there would be an
alert about Nicolas Cage anytime someone tried to load the website.  The
write-up was put into HTML format and special attention was put into checking
the grammer, spelling, and style of this page.  Finally, this is all located
in the correct folder on GitHub.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.

I spent over 8 hours working on this assignment.
