	<h1>Security and Privacy Assessment of Not Foursquare</h1>
	<h2>By: Lillianna Levonick</h2>
	<h3>8/10/2016</h3>

	<div class = "section"><p>Introduction</p></div>
	<hr></hr>
	<p>This product is meant to hold users locations at a specific point in time.  It does this by logging a person’s username, latitude, longitude, and time that they are checking-in into a database.  I was hired to assess any potential vulnerability within this web application.  This document describes my findings as well as ways to resolve the problems I have found.</p>

	<div class = "section"><p>Methodology</p></div>
	<hr>
	<p>First I downloaded the source code that was given to me and ran the web application locally.  After that was done, I attempted some “black box” testing with the main webpage of the application.  I did so by adding some queries into the search bar and by using the curl command in my terminal to try to add login and location information.  When I did this with no results, I decided to move onto “white box” testing where I went over the source code.  Once I read the source code I was able to better understand where I should try to attack the website and used curl as well as an HTML file I wrote in order to attack the application.  Once I was done testing my attacks on the local app I configured, I then sent them over to the actual Not Foursquare application using the same methods.</p>

	<div class = "section"><p>Abstract of Findings</p></div>
	<hr></hr>
	<p>Many of the problems I found stem from not protecting the application from user input.  By trusting the user, the application is leaving itself wide open to attacks, making it recommendable to not release this application until some of its issues are fixed.  Despite its issues, this application does protect against a few things well.  For instance, it does not store additional fields of user information into the mongodb database.  This saves storage space if someone decides to add random fields to a new check-in with a command like: <code>curl –data “login=bob&lat=0&lng=0&extrafield=whatever” http://vunerableapp.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</code>.  Also, this application protects against any impossible latitude or longitude values that may get inserted as input into the application.</p>

	<div class = "section"><p>Issues Found</p></div>
	<hr></hr>
	<ol>
	<li>Injection</li>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Issue found at vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</p></li>
		
		<li><p><span class = "high">High</span>: This issue allows an attacker to send untrusted data to the database by exploiting the syntax of checking-in on this application.  This is an issue because it can allow someone to inject images, other html files, and much more into the login section of the check-in. Although corrupted data can later taken out of the mongodb database this problem can lead to issues like data loss and corruption, justifying its severity level.  Also, this level is due to how this issue is easy to exploit and has a severe impact.</p></li>

		<li><p>By using the command <img src='pictures/example1/iframe2.png'/> I was able to embed a different html file within  my local version of the application in the login field.  This is what the main page of the application looks like while having this logged as one of the check-ins:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example1/iframe1.png'/></p><p>This check-in data can then be accessed in mongodb and removed if that is desired.</p><p><img src ='pictures/example1/iframe3.png'/></p><p>However, if the embedded file were a harmful website then it may already be too late when trying to fix this problem retroactively as users may have already witnessed the harmful content.  Also, by using this command <img src='pictures/example1/img2.png'/> I was able to inject an image into the local web application through the login field.  The result of this on the main webpage can be seen here:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example1/img1.png'/></p><p>This poses the same issues as the embedded html file and can be accessed and removed in mongodb in the same fashion.</p><p><image src ='pictures/example1/img3.png'/></p></li>

		<li><p>In order to resolve this issue, untrusted data must be separated from commands and queries.  Whitelist input validation can be used where you can define exactly what is authorized, making everything else unauthorized.  This way special characters can’t be used in the input.</p></li>
		</ul>

	<p></p>
	<li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Issue found at vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</p></li>

		<li><p><span class = "high">High</span>: This is a problem similar to that of injection, but instead of putting untrusted data into the application this security problem allows attackers to send text-based attack scripts that will affect Not Foursquare.  Corrupted data may also be removed retroactively from the mongodb database; however, before this happens the attacker can perform actions like hijack user sessions or insert hostile content into the application.</p></li>

		<li><p>In order to take advantage of this security weakness I used the command:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example2/alert3.png'/></p><p>This made an alert window appear on the application when the main page is loaded:</p><p><img src = 'pictures/example2/alert1.png'/></p><p>Once the alert window was exited out of then the check-in information appears as normal:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example2/alert2.png'/></p><p>This data can then be accessed in mongodb in order to be removed:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example2/alert4.png'/></p><p>This alert is a nuisance to the user, and if more malicious code were put in place of it the users browser could be in danger of getting hijacked.</p></li>

		<li><p>This issue can be resolved in the same way as injection with whitelist input validation.</p></li>
		</ul>
	
	<p></p>
	<li>Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards</li>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Issue found at vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</p></li>

		<li><p><span class = "mod">Moderate</span>: This problem can allow attackers to redirect users to any other webpage, including malicious websites.  Although this problem will cause a user to be sent to a website that they don’t want to go to, the severity is set to moderate because it is easy to detect, prevent, and fix this issue after it happens.  Also, this severity is moderate as the solutions to other issues in this application will make this problem go away.</p></li>

		<li><p>By utilizing the issue of cross-site scripting in the Not Foursquare application, I ran this command:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example4/redirect3.png'/></p><p>This made it so when the user tries to load vunerableapp.herokuapp.com their browser redirects them to a completely different webpage:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example4/redirect1.png'/></p><p>This redirect not only means that the user can’t access the actual webpage of the application correctly, but that they may be sent to a malicious website or even fall victim to a phishing attack.  This corrupted data can be accessed in mongodb and removed if wanted:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example4/redirect2.png'/></p></li>

		<li><p>This issue can also be resolved with whitelist input validation, as it stems from the cross-site scripting problem in this application.</p></li>
		</ul>
	
	<p></p>
	<li>Sensitive Data Exposure</li>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Issue found at vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com/checkins.json as well as vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com</p></li>

		<li><p><span class = "mod">Moderate</span>: This issue stems from how an attacker can access sensitive data about a user from this application.  Any data that should have been protected then becomes compromised due to this problem.  The severity of this issue is moderate as it would be difficult for an attacker to exploit these issues.</p></li>

		<li><p>Part of this issue is that on the main application website you are able to see a person’s exact latitude and longitude at a given time of day.</p><p><img src ='pictures/example3/pri1.png'/></p><p>This is a privacy issue because it can tell attackers the exact location of a user without them even having to do anything! This kind of issue is also prevalent in check-in features that Facebook has: <a href ='http://www.wafb.com/story/14603770/hidden-dangers-from-checking-in-on-facebook'>http://www.wafb.com/story/14603770/hidden-dangers-from-checking-in-on-facebook</a></p><p>An attacker can also utilize the vunerableapp.herokuapp.com/checkins.json page in order to get sensitive information about the user.  This is because if they add the right query to this address all the data about a user’s check-in will pop-up.  For instance when I type this into a search bar:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example3/pri2.png'/></p><p>This is what appears:</p><p><img src ='pictures/example3/pri3.png'/></p><p>This means that I can now also access the _id value of the data which was not shown on the main page of the website.</p></li>

		<li><p>To resolve this issue cryptography can be employed in order to encode sensitive data in the mongodb database, so even if accessed the attacker can’t use the information for their own purposes.  Also, restricting who is able to see a user’s check-in on the main application page may solve some of the privacy issues of anybody online being capable of seeing it.</p></li>
		</ul>

	<p></p>
	<li>Sharing With Every Origin</li>
		<ul>
		<li><p>Issue found at vulnerableapp.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</p></li>

		<li><p><span class = "high">High</span>: This issue allows attackers to send an XHR request to Not Foursquare with any website due to the enabling of CORS.  The problem poses a high security risk as any site can then make a request to Not Foursqaure on behalf of their users and then process the response.</p></li>

		<li><p>An attacker is able to post a check-in and add it to the application’s database through any html page that has an XHR post request for vunerableapp.herokuapp.com/sendLocation because of this problem.  To demonstrate this issue I wrote a simple html file that would do this to my local version of Not Foursquare:</p><p><img src='pictures/example5/code1.png'/></p><p>When opened this html file has no text or images but it was successful in putting a new check-in into my local version of the application due to the <code>request.send</code> command:</p><p><img src='pictures/example5/code2.png'/></p><p>The website I created was able to do this because of this code in the application's server:</p><p><img src='pictures/example5/code4.png'/></p></li>

		<li><p>The resolution to this issue is to use an origin header file in order to tell the server what the regular XHR requests are going to be.</p></li>
		</ul>	
	</ol>

	<div class = "section"><p>Conclusion</p></div>
	<hr></hr>
	<p>Before being used by the public Not Foursquare should try to adjust its code in order to fix some of the issues described above, or else it may run into some major problems down the road, mainly due to its trust in user input.  The resolutions to the application’s problems are relatively easy to implement as a lot of the solutions overlap, so it should not be too much of a hassle to fix them.  However, the current structure of the application where user privacy is disregarded by placing their location at a certain time for anyone to see can be problematic, and should be looked into.</p>
